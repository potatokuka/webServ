read this to understand writing tests
	https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html

in project_root CMakeLists.txt add:
	`add_subdirectory(module_name)`

write your .cpp and .hpp files in src/
make corresponding .cpp test files in tst/

build using build.sh from project_root
test using test.sh from project_root

write any random stuff you want in main.cpp to test quickly, but write tests for functions!
	compile from project_root,
	will make binary at ./$MODULE/$MODULE.run
